*de novo* Transcriptome assembly of bee viruses.

Bees herein refer to either honey bee *Apis mellifera* or *Andrena spp.*

This repository is in support of a manuscript submission (submitted Dec. 30, 2020).

13 samples (described in the accompanying publication):
- were sequenced (HiSeq 4000 and MiSeq).
- The sequence was processed to count and remove reads associated with certain species. 
- The remaining reads (enriched for virus reads) were assembled with Trinity. 
- Contigs were given putatitive identities by performing blast searches.
